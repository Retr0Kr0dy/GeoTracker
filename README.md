# GeoTracker
### Python based web server for precise geolocation.

# How it should work

Hosting a web server that's used for `geolocation` from the client navigator and then redirect to url.

`geolocation` section isn't accessible when `GET` as `http`, must be `https`.

Tunnel can be used for the `https` flag.
